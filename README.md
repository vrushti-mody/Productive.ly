Productive.ly is a gamified sprint system with a goal to make open source contribution and team collaboration more fun and less tedious.

By integrating a simple points system in the GitHub issues tab, it encourages coders to meet their tasks to earn the maximum points possible from their manager. These points can then be used to offer incentives, which will inevitably boost productivity.


## How is this tool helpful?

- Github gives us the option to milestone issues. Our application will help keep track of issues belonging to a milestone.
- Our application will assign points to issues. The points can be redeemed once a successful Pull Request (PR) is made and merged. Additional Points are also given to reviewers once a Pull Request is merged.
- In order to boost the morale of the employees, the points that they gain for a task can be used to defeat a monster. If 90% of the tasks are finished, then the sprint will be considered successful and the monster will be defeated.
