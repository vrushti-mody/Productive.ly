## Guidelines to use the application

- In order to start a sprint, you need to milestone your issues. You can read more about milestones[`here`](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-milestones)

- If you need help with creating a milestone, refer to the docs [`here`](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-and-editing-milestones-for-issues-and-pull-requests)

- The due date of the milestone should be greater than the current date for it to be visible in the application. 

## What are sprints?

A Sprint is a short, time-boxed period during which a Scrum Team works to complete the set amount of work. Sprints are at the core of Scrum, and by getting them right, companies can help agile teams ship high-quality software, faster and more frequently. Most importantly, working in Sprints gives teams more flexibility and allows easier (and less costly) adaptation to change.

## How can Github Milestones be used for creating Sprints?

- GitHub doesn’t have the notion of a “sprint”, but it does have a similar metaphor: a Milestone.

- Each Milestone has only three elements: a Title, a Body, and an optional due date.

- By setting the due dates of milestones to be in the coming week or two, you can start sprinting 

## How does our application help?

- Our application helps keep track of the backlogs in each sprint/ milestone

- It gamifies the sprint system to boost the productivity of employees

- It creates a leaderboard with the top contributions of employees so that the management knows the top contributors in the company
